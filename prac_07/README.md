# CP1404 Practicals Repository

## About This Repository
Welcome to my CP1404 practicals repository. This repo contains all my work for practical exercises in CP1404, demonstrating my understanding of Python programming, classes, file handling, and clean code principles.  

**Author:** Roshik Maharjan

## Practicals Included
- **Practical 07 - Classes 2**
  - Programming Languages Loader (`language_file_reader.py`, `programming_language.py`, `languages.csv`)
  - Guitar Management (`guitar.py`, `myguitars.py`, `guitars.csv`)
  - Project Management Program (`project.py`, `project_management.py`, `projects.txt`)

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
Through these practicals, I learned several key principles of writing clean, maintainable code:

- Use **meaningful names** for variables, functions, and classes to make code self-documenting.  
- Apply **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: each function/class should have one responsibility.  
- Write **modular and reusable code** by separating functionality into functions, classes, and modules.  
- Keep **consistent formatting and indentation**, making the code readable.  
- Comment and document **only when necessary**, letting the code structure explain itself where possible.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.  
2. Open it in an IDE like PyCharm for full syntax highlighting and code navigation.  
3. Run individual practical scripts (like `language_file_reader.py` or `project_management.py`) to see them in action.  
4. Follow instructions in each practical folder to modify or extend the programs as required.
