# Practical 10 – Reflection

## 1. What have you learned in this subject so far?
This subject has helped me improve my skills in Python, especially in:
- writing cleaner, more modular code  
- using functions properly (SRP)  
- testing using asserts and doctests  
- working with external APIs  
- building basic Flask web applications  

## 2. What are you most confident with?
I feel confident with:
- writing reusable functions  
- working with lists, loops and strings  
- using Git and GitHub to manage my practicals  
- debugging simple errors  

## 3. What do you still find challenging?
I still find it challenging to:
- think ahead about edge cases when designing functions  
- understand exception handling deeply  
- design recursive solutions  
- work with new libraries quickly  

## 4. What would you like more practice with?
- More practice with APIs  
- More Flask examples  
- More recursion exercises  
- More testing with doctest and PyCharm  

## 5. Link to two of your best code reviews
Below are two code reviews I believe show my best improvements:

1. **Code Review 1:**  
<PASTE_URL_HERE>  
*Explanation:* This review helped me fix structure and naming, improving readability.

2. **Code Review 2:**  
<PASTE_URL_HERE>  
*Explanation:* I learned how to simplify functions and reduce repetition.

## 6. Summary
Overall, this subject has helped me understand good coding practices, testing, and how to build applications that can run on the web. I feel more confident continuing into later subjects.
